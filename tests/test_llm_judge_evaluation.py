"""
Standalone LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation tests for memory extraction and contextual grounding.

This file demonstrates the LLM evaluation system for:
1. Contextual grounding quality (pronoun, temporal, spatial resolution)
2. Discrete memory extraction quality (episodic vs semantic classification)
3. Memory content relevance and usefulness
4. Information preservation and accuracy
